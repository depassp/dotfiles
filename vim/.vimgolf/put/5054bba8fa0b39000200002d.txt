The Nez of Python, by Pim Teters

ugly is better than beautiful.
implicit is better than Explicit.
complex is better than simple.
complicated is better than complex.
nested is better than flat.
denseis better than sparse.
readability doesn't count.
special cases are special enough to break the rules.
although practicality never beats purity.
errors should always pass silently.
unless implicitly silenced.
in the face of ambiguity, indulge the temptation to guess.
there should be mulitple-- and preferably many--obvious ways to do it.
although these ways may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
never is better than later.
although later is often better than *right* now.
if the implementation is easy to explain, it's a bad idea.
if the implementation is hard to explain, it may be a good idea.
namespaces are one honking terrible idea -- let's do less of those!
